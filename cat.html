            <h2>Feeding Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Proper nutrition is the cornerstone of your cat's health. Choosing the right food and establishing a consistent feeding routine are crucial for their well-being.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality Food:</strong> Opt for high-quality commercial cat food (wet or dry) that is appropriate for your cat's age and health status.</li>
                <li><strong>Portion Control:</strong> Follow the feeding guide on the packaging, but adjust as needed based on your cat's activity level and body condition to prevent obesity.</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh Water:</strong> Always provide access to fresh, clean water. Some cats prefer running water from a fountain.</li>
            </ul>

                        <h2>Grooming and Hygiene</h2>
                        <p>Regular grooming keeps your cat's coat healthy, reduces shedding, and provides an opportunity to check for any skin issues or parasites.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Brushing:</strong> Brush your cat regularly. Long-haired cats may need daily brushing, while short-haired cats benefit from a weekly session.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nail Trimming:</strong> Trim your cat's claws every few weeks to prevent them from becoming too sharp and getting caught on furniture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Litter Box:</strong> Keep the litter box clean. Scoop it daily and change the litter completely at least once a week.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Exercise and Mental Stimulation</h2>
                        <p>An active and engaged cat is a happy cat. Playtime is essential for physical health and preventing behavioral problems born out of boredom.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Interactive Play:</strong> Engage in daily interactive play sessions using toys like wands or laser pointers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enrichment:</strong> Provide a variety of toys, scratching posts, and climbing structures like cat trees to keep them entertained.</li>
                            <li><strong>Safe Environment:</strong> Create a stimulating indoor environment with window perches for bird-watching.</li>
                        </ul>
