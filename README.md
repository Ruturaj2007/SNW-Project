I worked alone to develop this project.  I wrote and tested all of my code using Visual Studio Code as my main development environment.  Throughout the development process, I worked locally, but in order to maintain the final working version, I committed the entire project to version control at the end.  Since this was a one-off project, the repository shows the final implementation rather than small steps forward.
