                        <h2>Feeding Guidelines</h2>
                        <p>Providing a balanced diet is crucial for your dog's health. Ensure you are feeding high-quality dog food appropriate for their age, size, and activity level.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Quality Food:</strong> Choose high-quality commercial dog food (wet or dry) that is appropriate for your dog's age and health status.</li>
                            <li><strong>Portion Control:</strong> Follow the feeding guide on the packaging, but adjust as needed based on your dog's activity level and body condition to prevent obesity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fresh Water:</strong> Always provide access to fresh, clean water. Change it daily and ensure the bowl is clean.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Grooming and Hygiene</h2>
                        <p>Regular grooming keeps your dog's coat and skin healthy. Here are the basics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Brushing:</strong> Regular brushing removes loose hair, dirt, and prevents matting. The frequency depends on your dog's coat type.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> Bathe your dog as needed, but not too often, as it can strip natural oils from their skin. Use a dog-specific shampoo.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nail Trimming:</strong> Overly long nails can be painful and cause issues. Trim them regularly, being careful not to cut the quick.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dental Care:</strong> Brush your dog's teeth several times a week with dog-friendly toothpaste to prevent dental disease.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Exercise and Mental Stimulation</h2>
                        <p>A tired dog is a happy dog. Daily exercise helps manage weight, reduce behavioral problems, and strengthen your bond.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Daily Exercise:</strong> Most dogs need at least 30-60 minutes of physical activity per day. This can include walks, runs, or playtime in the yard.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mental Stimulation:</strong> Engage your dog's mind with puzzle toys, training sessions, and games like hide-and-seek to prevent boredom and anxiety.</li>
                            <li><strong>Socialization:</strong> Regular interaction with other dogs and people helps maintain your dog's social skills and prevents behavioral issues.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>
                                Common mistakes include inconsistent training, which can confuse your dog; lack of socialization during puppyhood, leading to behavioral issues; ignoring regular veterinary check-ups for preventative care; and humanizing dog behavior, which can lead to misunderstanding and ineffective training.

                            <p>
                                Puppies should visit the vet every 3-4 weeks until they're 16 weeks old for vaccinations and check-ups. Adult dogs should have an annual wellness exam, and senior dogs (7+ years) should visit every 6 months. Always consult your veterinarian for a schedule tailored to your dog's needs.
