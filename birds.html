                            <p>
                                Common mistakes include feeding an all-seed diet, which lacks essential nutrients; using non-stick cookware (Teflon) which can release toxic fumes; neglecting socialization, leading to behavioral issues; and housing birds in a cage that is too small for their species. Always research your bird's specific needs.

                            <p>
                                Spot clean daily by removing droppings and uneaten food. Change cage liners every day.
